# Yellow + Quotes — the decision rules (when YES, when NO)

The single authoritative ruleset for the spice caption color/quote axis. The `caption_director.py`
SYSTEM prompt encodes this; this doc is the human/agent reference. Append new calls as the reference editor reviews land.

## The ONE principle
**COLOR = WHOSE VOICE.**
- **White** = Speaker speaking as *himself* (narration, argument, direct address to the viewer).
- **Yellow `#FECB00`** = Speaker speaking *as / quoting / role-playing someone else*.
- **Quotes `" "`** wrap that other-voice speech. On reported speech, **yellow + italic + quotes always travel together** — same span, same words.

Color is about *voice*, nothing else. It is NOT an emphasis tool.

## ✅ YELLOW + ITALIC + QUOTES — YES (a voice that isn't Speaker-as-himself)
- **Character dialogue** in a told story — `"mom"`, `"but why??"`, `"sweetie"`, `"Miller family tradition"`
- **A customer / objection / what "people" say** — `"yeah, he had an excuse"`, `"you are a special snowflake"`
- **A "here's what you say" script / line to deliver** — `"where you're coming from"`
- **A saying / aphorism** he quotes
- **A hypothetical person's words** — *the people who love you might say,* `"...you are special..."`
- **A study / source quoted in its own voice** (the instructions, the line said to subjects)
- **A live Q&A guest** — their whole turn (same span mechanism)

## ❌ NOT YELLOW — stays WHITE (Speaker's own voice / other axes carry it)
- **Speaker's own narration, argument, or direct address** — *"you're not gonna earn anyone's respect"*
- **Numbers & money** — `$100M`, `19`, `2 min` → emphasize with **WEIGHT / SIZE**, never color
- **Proper nouns** — `Princeton`, `Apollo Creed`, `Bangladesh` → **capitalize + keep white**
- **Emphasis / punchline words** — a key word goes heavier **WEIGHT** or bigger **SIZE**, NOT yellow
- **Rhetorical questions Speaker asks as himself** — *"is that what you really want?"*
- **The lead-in to a quote** — *"and everyone will be like,"* / *"the people who love you might say,"* is white; the quote that FOLLOWS is yellow

> Litmus test: *Could you put "—he said" or "—they'd say" after it?* If yes → yellow+quoted. If it's Speaker making his own point → white.

## How a quote renders (mechanics)
1. Reported speech is a **CONTIGUOUS SPAN**: opening quote on the FIRST word, closing quote on the LAST.
2. **Per-cue quotes** — every caption segment of the span shows its own `" ... "` (The reference editor's rule), not just the first/last cue.
3. **ALL-OR-NOTHING** — *every* word first→last is yellow+italic+quoted, **including function/connective words** (the, a, that, I, to, he, had, an, until, your, of...). Never leave a mid-quote word white. (Emphasis weight/size MAY still vary word-to-word inside the span.)
4. **No bleed** — the word *immediately after* the quote is WHITE. The quote must not color the next word.
5. **Separate spans** — narration that resumes between two quotes is white; open a NEW span for the next quote.

## Mechanism (automated, so it can't regress)
`caption_director.py` emits each quote as `voice_spans: [[first_idx, last_idx]]` (word indices), force-expands the whole range to `c=guest + i=true + q=true`, then emits **`voice_spans: []`** (per-word color is the single source of truth — a leftover time-range bleeds yellow onto the next word). `generate_spice.py` renders per-word color/italic + per-cue quotes.

## Worked examples (real clips, 2026-06-04)
- **Excuses** — `"you know what, I'm going to continue to live the life that I want until I die"` is ONE span: every word yellow+quoted, **not just** *live/life/die*. `"he had an excuse"` (×2): all four words, **not just** *excuse*.
- **Mediocrity** — `"yeah, you know what, you are special, you are a special snowflake, your mama might still love you"` is ONE span. The next word `you're` is **WHITE** (Speaker resumes) — this is the no-bleed rule (it was wrongly yellow until fixed).
- **Capacity** — the Princeton **"Good Samaritan"** study is Speaker *narrating* (he voices no character) → **all white**; `Princeton` / `Samaritan` capitalized, never yellow.

*Append approved YES/NO calls from future the reference editor reviews here so the director keeps learning.*
