"""speaker_diarize.py — PER-WORD speaker (Speaker vs guest) for Q&A captions.

The EDL 'speaker' is per CAMERA SHOT, so a short turn-response word ("yes", "cool", "no")
spoken at a turn boundary gets mis-attributed to whoever held the previous shot — coloring
the caption for the WRONG speaker (Speaker's "cool" painted yellow; the guest's "yes" painted
white). Two signals fix it, in priority order:

  1. MIC ENERGY (ground truth): Q&A clips have separate per-speaker mics, so whoever's mic is
     louder during a word said it. Trusted outright when one mic wins by >= CONF dB.
  2. CONVERSATIONAL TURN-TAKING (Operator): at a turn boundary the mics are low-margin
     (bleed/overlap) and can't decide. There, a short REPLY token ("yes"/"cool"/"right") belongs
     to the RESPONDER — i.e. the OTHER speaker from the word before it. That's why Speaker's "cool"
     after the guest's line is Speaker, and the guest's "yes" after Speaker's "are you the biggest?"
     is the guest, even when the two mics read ~equal.
  3. EDL shot-speaker — fallback only when neither signal applies.

Used by edit/scripts/qa_assembly.py AND qa_build.py so the rule is identical everywhere.
