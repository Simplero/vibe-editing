"""qa_editorial_score — the EDITORIAL transcript gate for Q&A clips (2026-06-17).

Turns the 250-pair winner-vs-loser analysis (qa_clip_patterns.md → "TRANSCRIPT EDITORIAL
TRANSFORM") into an enforced gate. Scores a clip's spoken transcript on the 5 dimensions that
separate top10 from bottom25, and BLOCKS the editorial patterns that land bottom-25:

  1. HOOK CLASS      — plain_statement opener = 0.23x DEATH hook → FAIL. Want confession /
                       vivid_image / contrarian_claim. (number/question = neutral WARN.)
  2. PAYOFF CLASS    — ending on wind_down (0.06x) / bare tactic (0.11x) / cta (0x) = FAIL.
                       Want principle / story_button / number_reframe / tough_love.
  3. PORTABILITY     — the #1 predictor (2.89x). Read hook+payoff cold: do both stand alone? FAIL if no.
  4. ONE ARC         — two competing threads = WARN.
  5. OPENER CLEAN    — mid-fragment / lowercase / hedge open = FAIL (never open mid-thought).

Uses the local `claude` CLI for the judgment (it's authed; same pattern as tam_select). Falls
back to heuristics if the CLI is unavailable. Run at edit Step 4 (after designing keep-spans,
BEFORE render) and again as a pre-render gate on the delivered transcript.

Usage:
  qa_editorial_score.py --transcript-json <file>   # {name: {title, transcript}} → scores each
  qa_editorial_score.py --text "<clip transcript>"  # score one
  echo '<transcript>' | qa_editorial_score.py -
Exit 0 = all PASS. Exit 1 = ≥1 FAIL.

RULESET = """You are the EDITORIAL gate for an the creator Q&A short, scoring its TRANSCRIPT against
The reference editor's team SOP (the CLIPPER AI PROMPT), confirmed by 250 perf-tiered raw→final pairs. Score ONLY the text.

HOOK (the first sentence) — the CONTRAST HOOK is the standard (Speaker's own directive):
  WIN = activity/what-they-do FIRST, then the revenue ("I sell property in the UAE and we do $6M" /
    "I print stickers and make $1.5M") — the mundane-activity + big-number contrast = the "holy shit" magnet.
    Also winning: confession (raw admission), vivid_image, contrarian_claim, an immediate attention-grabber
    ("well, that's a racket", "$10M but our profit is shit").
  ACCEPTABLE — DO NOT FAIL (The reference editor ships these): an activity→revenue opener that names WHAT they do + the
    number ("we do business coaching for PT practices, $2.1M last year") even if it's not a "holy shit"
    contrast. It IS the contrast-hook form. Prefer a punchier line if one genuinely exists in the raw, but a
    clear activity→revenue opener PASSES — WARN at most, never FAIL. (Many real guests have no punchy hook.)
  DEATH (FAIL only these): a truly flat declarative with NO number AND no activity-identity AND no stakes;
    OR revenue-FIRST bragging with no activity ("we do $6M" alone); OR a mid-sentence lowercase fragment;
    OR a GREETING / NAME-INTRO opener ("my name is…", "hi, I'm X with the Y team", "hey") — that's the
    pleasantry the reference editor always cuts; drop it and OPEN on what they do + the number (a name-intro
    clip opened on "my name is X, I'm with the Y team" and buried the big number six seconds in).
  PREFACE BLOAT (The reference editor's #1 underperformance cause): the opener must satisfy the HOOK FILTER — either a
    short preface (≤15s of setup) OR an attention-grabber. Long setup + delayed grab = FAIL.

PAYOFF (the last sentence):
  WINNING: principle (portable universal maxim — 74% of winners), belief-breaker, Speaker's professional opinion,
    story_button, number_reframe, tough_love. Must be CONCRETE and understandable without extra context.
  DEATH: wind_down (trailing off / guest reaction / "land the plane" — 0.06x, deadliest), a NICHE tactic that
    only helps this one guest (0.11x — a widely-applicable actionable step is fine; a guest-specific one is not),
    cta (sales pitch — 0x), cliffhanger / dangling question.

PORTABILITY (#1 predictor, 2.89x): read ONLY the first line + last line as a cold viewer with zero context.
  Does the hook intrigue AND the payoff resolve it, standalone? Niche diagnostics that need the whole case = NOT portable.

ONE ARC: a single Problem → Solution loop (the "One-Hit" model — The Lesson, not The Journey). Two distinct
  PROBLEMS being solved = FAIL (split into separate clips). BUT a supporting story / example / anecdote — even
  the speaker's own (e.g. a business they once sold) — that REINFORCES the single principle is NOT a
  second arc; KEEP it. The test is "two problems being solved?", not "more than one example used."

REASONING LADDER (calibration case_001, 2026-06-17 — the one verified under-trim failure): when the payoff
  is a REFRAME or a NUMBER, keep the diagnosis→WHY ladder that EARNS it (the concrete figures, the mechanism,
  the ROI/value logic), and end on the portable PRINCIPLE — never amputate the middle so the clip jumps
  hook→tactic→done. A reframe/number payoff with its reasoning stripped to bookends = WARN "restore the why
  that makes the payoff land for a cold viewer." (Surgeon clip: the "$4M practice → 70% from this → I did $3M
  doing this → teach the business part → incremental value / direct ROI" ladder is what earns the price
  reframe; cutting straight from "underpriced" to "25K + 5K/yr" strips it.)
  COUNTER-COST (do NOT overcorrect into going long): this is not a license to pad. Duration does NOT separate
  tiers (winner median ≈35s; many winners <30s; duration↔views r≈0.09). Trim hard — cut tangents, side-quests,
  logistics, the 2nd thread — just don't cut the spine that makes the payoff make sense. Keep the WHY, not the length.

NO-DETOUR / OVER-LENGTH (cold-start validation 2026-06-17 — the #1 cold-session failure: cuts ran ~2x the reference editor):
  once the answer/diagnosis is REACHED, DELETE the remaining diagnostic back-and-forth. Flag (WARN) any cut that
  keeps Socratic Q&A, logistics, or "still figuring it out" exchanges AFTER the payoff logic has landed — the reference editor
  cuts almost straight from the stakes to the answer. (Guest cold cut 128s vs the reference editor 80s; Guest 128s vs 68s — both
  kept a diagnostic middle the reference editor removed.) The arc is hook → minimum WHY → answer; extra rounds of diagnosis = cut.

CONTEXT-FIRST HOOK (cold-start miss — pelvic-floor): the opener must establish the GUEST's business + problem,
  NOT open cold on Speaker's rhetorical question ("how many gyms do you think I had?"). If the winning context line
  sits earlier in the raw, HUNT BACKWARD for it and open there. Opening on Speaker's question with no guest setup = a
  hook MISS (a cold viewer doesn't know who the advice is for).

NO-RESTATEMENT ENDING (cold-start miss — Guest): ending on a conceptual LABEL or a restatement of the problem
  ("that's how you generate leads", "it's a lead-gen campaign") = a wind-down, FAIL. End one beat FORWARD on the
  CONCRETE quantified result/principle ("you'll probably sell more than a hundred carts"). When the reference editor had numbers,
  he ended on the numbers — prefer the concrete result over the abstract label.

BRAND / CLIENT-PULL SAFETY: flag (WARN) exact price points ("my price is $X"), "I fired [name]", or other
  specific/sensitive details a client could want pulled. Revenue/profit framing only.

VERDICT: FAIL if hook is plain_statement/revenue-first/none/Preface-Bloat, OR payoff is wind_down/niche-tactic/
  cta/cliffhanger, OR not portable, OR two competing arcs, OR opener is a mid-sentence fragment. WARN for
  neutral hooks, client-pull risks, or minor issues. PASS only if the hook is a contrast/winning class, the
  payoff is a portable principle/concrete advice, it's ONE arc, and it passes the cold test.
