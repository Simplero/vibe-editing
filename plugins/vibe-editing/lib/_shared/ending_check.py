"""ending_check.py — THE canonical "did we cut the speaker off / false ending" rule. ONE home,
shared by window_validator (pre-cut), reqc (post-delivery), and build_ad (testimonial ads).

A clip MUST end on a COMPLETE thought. It is a FALSE ENDING (cut-off sentence) when, in the SOURCE,
the same speaker keeps going on the same clause after our end point — i.e. the last kept word is NOT
sentence-terminal AND the next source word continues the clause (lowercase, no new turn). Also a
false ending if the clip ends ON a word that NEVER ends a sentence (and/but/the/a/to/of/which/…).

Hard gate for ALL content domains (Q&A, workshops/ads, listicle, podcast, monologue). Origin:
a CMO review (2026-06-17): "the AI cuts off the speaker and goes to the end bumper".

⚠️ DESIGN NOTE: prepositions like at/on/by/for/with/in/from/up/out are NOT treated as mid-clause —
they legitimately end a sentence via phrasal verbs ("what we're good at.", "someone to rely on.",
"the problem I showed up for."). Only words that can NEVER end a complete sentence are hard-failed;
prepositions/content-word endings are judged by source continuation. (The "good at" false-positive
was caught on the DirectHomeOffers test, 2026-06-17.)

Two entry points:
  ends_complete(end_word, next_words)  — pre-cut / source-mapped: has the SOURCE words AFTER the end.
  tail_only_verdict(last_words)        — post-delivery fallback: only the delivered clip's own tail
                                          → catches a hard mid-clause ending; ("ok"|"fail"|"unknown").
